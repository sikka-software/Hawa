import { Meta, ArgsTable, Story } from "@storybook/blocks";
import * as DialogStories from "../../stories/ElementsStories/Dialog.stories.tsx";
import { Button, DialogContent, CodeBlock } from "../../components/elements";

<Meta title="Installation" />

<div>
  <h1>Installation</h1>

  <p>Run one of the following commands to add Hawa to your project:</p>
  <CodeBlock
    tabs={[
      {
        title: "npm",
        code: "npm install @sikka/hawa",
      },
      {
        title: "yarn",
        code: "yarn add @sikka/hawa",
      },
      {
        title: "pnpm",
        code: "pnpm add @sikka/hawa",
      },
    ]}
  />
</div>

Note: The @beta tag is used for pre-releases. Use the @latest tag for the latest stable release.

After installation, import the components you want to use from `@sikka/hawa`. For example:

```javascript
import { Button } from '@sikka/hawa';

function App() {
  return (
    <Button>Click me</Button>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This way, you can start using the UI components provided by `@sikka/hawa` in your project.
