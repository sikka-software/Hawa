description: The texts object used to translate blocks
---

## Concept

The texts object is used to translate texts that exist in blocks. It is a simple key-value object where the key is the text to translate and the value is the translated text.

## Example

If we take the [`LoginForm`](/docs/blocks/login-form) block as an example, it has two texts that can be translated: `username` and `password`. The texts object for this block would look like this:

```jsx
<LoginForm
  texts={{
    username: {
      label: "Username",
      placeholder: "Enter your username",
      required: "Username is required"
    },
    password: {
      label: "Password",
      placeholder: "Enter your password",
      required: "Password is required"
    }
  }}
  {...otherProps}
/>
```

## Usage

The texts object is ideally used along with a i18n library. The texts object can be passed to the block as a prop and then the block can use the i18n library to translate the texts. This way the blocks can be used in different languages.

```jsx
<LoginForm
  texts={{
    username: {
      label: t("username.label"),
      placeholder: t("username.placeholder"),
      required: t("username.required")
    },
    password: {
      label: t("password.label"),
      placeholder: t("password.placeholder"),
      required: t("password.required")
    }
  }}
  {...otherProps}
/>
```
