The `useToast` hook is used to show and control toast messages. It returns an object with a `toast` function and a `toasts` state. The `toast` function is used to show a toast message.

The `toasts` state is an array of toast messages that are currently being shown.

Each toast message can be dismissed by clicking the x button or by swiping it away. The `toasts` state is updated when a toast message is dismissed.

```js
const { toast, toasts } = useToast();
```
