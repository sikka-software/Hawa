description: A hook to show and control toast messages
---

The `useToast` hook is used to show and control toast messages. It returns an object with a `toast` function and a `toasts` state. The `toast` function is used to show a toast message.

The `toasts` state is an array of toast messages that are currently being shown.

Each toast message can be dismissed by clicking the x button or by swiping it away. The `toasts` state is updated when a toast message is dismissed.

```js
const { toast, toasts } = useToast();
```

<br />

## toast (creator)

The `toast` function is used to show a toast message. It adds a toast message to the `toasts` state.

```js
toast({
  title: "The title of the toast message, in bold.",
  description: "The description of the toast message, in normal text.",
  severity: "info",
  size: "sm",
  action: <ToastAction>Action</ToastAction>
});
```

### Props

| title       | string          | The title of the toast message, in bold.                                         |
| description | string          | The description of the toast message, in normal text.                            |
| severity    | string          | The severity of the toast message. Can be "info", "success", "warning", "error". |
| size        | string          | The size of the toast message. Can be "default" or "sm".                         |
| action      | React component | The action of the toast message. Can be a button or a link.                      |

## toasts (state)

The `toasts` state is an array of toast messages that are currently being shown. This is typically passed to a [`Toaster`](/docs/elements/toaster) component.

```tsx
<Toaster toasts={toasts} />
```

But you can map through the `toasts` state and render each toast message individually with your own custom component.

```tsx
toasts.map((toast) => {
  return (
    <MyCustomToast
      key={toast.id}
      title={toast.title}
      description={toast.description}
      severity={toast.severity}
      size={toast.size}
      action={toast.action}
    />
  );
});
```
