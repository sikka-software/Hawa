`useClipboard` is a custom React hook that provides an easy way to interact with the clipboard. It returns an object with the following properties:

- `copy`: A function that takes a value as an argument and attempts to copy it to the clipboard. If the `navigator.clipboard` API is not supported, it will set an error.
- `reset`: A function that resets the state of the hook, clearing any errors and indicating that nothing has been copied.
- `error`: An error object if there was an error copying to the clipboard, otherwise `null`.
- `copied`: A boolean indicating whether the last copy operation was successful.

The hook accepts an optional configuration object with a `timeout` property. The `timeout` is the duration in milliseconds after which the `copied` state will be reset to `false`. The default `timeout` is 2000ms.

Here is an example of how to use this hook:

```tsx
import { useClipboard } from "@sikka/hawa/hooks";

function MyComponent() {
  const { copy, reset, error, copied } = useClipboard();

  return <div onClick={() => copy()}>This text will be copied</div>;
}
```
